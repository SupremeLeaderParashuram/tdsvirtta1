So I checked the available models using:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">llm model list\n</code></pre>\n<p>At that point, the Gemini model wasn’t listed.</p>\n<p>I then installed the <code>llm-openrouter</code> plugin, and after that, the Gemini model appeared in the list. However, I’m now facing the above authentication error.</p>\n<p>To test if the issue was only with Gemini and other models other than OpenAI models , I created a personal API key from OpenRouter and tried running a free model:(i tried free models on both keys from AIpipe and my personal account since it doesn’t need any credits to be purchased)</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-auto\">llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/qwen/qwen3-8b:free\n</code></pre>\n<p>This worked correctly with my OpenRouter API key, which confirms that the plugin is working fine.</p>\n<p>I’m confused about how to properly authenticate for other via AIPipe for OpenRouter using the <code>llm</code> CLI. I’ve been trying different approaches for the last two days but haven’t been able to resolve this.<br>\nCertainly! Here’s a grammatically correct and polished version of the message you want to add at the end:</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I also tried setting the API keys individually for OpenAI, OpenRouter(this is basically configured while installing the plugin <code>llm-openrouter</code>), and even my personal keys, using the key management options mentioned in the <code>llm</code> documentation. Additionally, I saw that our course page suggest changing the base URL like this:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"bash\"><code class=\"lang-bash\">export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1\nllm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, even this approach didn’t work for me.</p>\n<p>Could you kindly guide me on how to resolve this issue?</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time and help.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br>\n<strong>Meikanda Sivam</strong></p>"
